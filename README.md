# Phone-Operator (data structures project)

# Description
There is a phone operation station with 2 operators working in. The operators must establish connections between people trying to call each other on two sides of a city. Everything in this station is analog; there is only one physical cable to make people talk. This means that only one phone call may occur at the same time.

To make a phone call, you first must catch one of the operators idle. If the operator is idle and the line is also free, he/she can make you talk to your relative. If the operator is idle but the line is busy, or both operators are busy then you must wait. There are 20 people on this side of the city, trying to talk to their 20 relatives on the other side of the city.

The program ends when everybody on this side of the city has talked to his/her relative on the other side.
